      Hey! I am a Full Stack Developer, everything from setting logs up on a server
      to picking a css color. During the day I usually build things in Ruby
      (Rails 3/4/5) and Javascript (Angular & React). TDD is usually
      faster for me and I am a big fan of pair programming.
    </p>
    <p>
      You can usually hear me asking '<i>what can we try differently next time?
      </i>' and setting meeting goals. A business degree I did got me
      interested in improving human systems and agile management structures.
      Get in touch if you have any material to recommend :)
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside of work I try out new technologies, you can see some
      of it on my github. Right now I am playing with React-Native,
      Pheonix, and a Raspberry Pi with Python
    </p>
    <p>
      I write in: Ruby, Rails (3/4/5), JavaScript, Angular, React, HTML, SCSS,
      Shell
    </p>

      Tools: Capistrano, Webpack, Nginx, Digital Ocean, Heroku, Docker, Postgres, Redis,

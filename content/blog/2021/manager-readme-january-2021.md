My hope is that this answers a few questions about my thought process and adds a set of conversation starters. This does not replace getting to know each other and I expect it to change over time!

### My mission
Help people become the best they can be.

### My role
Build effective autonomous teams that can [focus on being productive][focus_productivity]. These pieces are based on Google’s [Project Aristotle][aristotle]:
- **Physiological safety.** Feel safe taking risks
- **Dependability.** Everyone meets the performance bar
- **Structure and Clarity.** Clear roles, plans, and goals
- **Meaning.** The work is important to you
- **Impact.** Your input matters

### What you should expect from me
- Provide context
  - Draw a full picture of the business and its priorities so that you can make good decisions
  - Shield the team from people trying to diver out attention and focus
  - Make relevant information easily discoverable
- Enabling growth
  - Help you grow your skills and [help you improve yourself][improve_yourself]
  - Develop management and leadership. [Including training and expectation setting][expectation_setting]
- Update processes
  - There is no guarantee a process that worked yesterday will still work today, buildup can quickly become scar tissue or bureaucracy
  - I try to avoid [Null Process][null_process] as much as I can
  - Change my behavior

### What you should not expect me to
- Manage your time
- Manage your task
- Agree with you on everything

### What I expect you to do
- **Do amazing work.** This is the expectation. Let me know if there is something preventing you from accomplishing this.
- **Disagree with me.** The best solution comes from a healthy level of debate. We need to be able to separate our ideas from our egos. I’ll challenge your ideas with the goal of coming to the best possible solution, I hope you’ll - challenge mine.
- **Tell me when I screw up.** This is very important. I screw up and sometimes don’t notice. I need to know or I’ll likely do it again.
- **Communicate.** One of my jobs is to provide context. Are you missing some? Let me know and I’ll fill you in or go find out.

### What I expect you not to do
- Execute without understanding the value
- Come to me with a problem before having though it

### Meeting Protocol
Meetings can be great or a potential waste of time. For that reason, here are some rules:

1. **Single owner** that manages the meeting.
1. **Clear agenda and desirable outcome in the calendar.** If there's no agenda, don't accept. I won't.
1. **Start on time.** If someone is late, start without them. If you can't, cancel the meeting. Don't wait for people! It's bad education.
1. **Action items with ownership are mandatory.** A meeting is useless if there's no TODO at the end of it. Also, if there's no owner to each of them, they won't happen.
1. **Schedule ONLY if necessary.** [Use the link to decide.][meeting_guide]
1. **Minimize attendance.** Only invite required people. Don't invite nice-to-have-you's. More people, less potential value from the meeting.
1. **Feel free to get up and leave** if a meeting is useless to you, or if you have nothing to contribute. Don't worry, you can do that to anyone, myself included.

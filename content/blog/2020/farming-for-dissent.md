A good habit for the success of large projects is getting 'buy-in' or alignment from peers prior to starting. One of the challenges is that it can be hard to avoid a [groupthink][groupthink] trap and accidentally approach others who will agree with you. Another seeming innocuous challenge is just creating a low-barrier forum for others to bring concerns forward, especially when they are busy focusing on what is on their own plates.

Having just read [No Rules Rules][no_rules_rules] from Netflix, they recommend a pretty simple approach to quickly get coarse grain feedback.

Send out to a wide group of peers:
 1. A written outline of the project, and
 1. A google form with three fields. Name, rating, and a section for notes:

| Name | Rating (-10/+10) | Notes
| ---  | ---              | ---
| Biz  | 6                | Good incremental improvement
| Baz  | -4               | Will compete with a feature my team is about to launch
| Buzz | 8                | I wanted this for ages!

While this is not exhaustive, you can quickly get a view on where there might be disagreement and avoid the groupthink trap. Another benefit is you have a clear direction on where to follow up next.

I think the power here is creating an easy forum to engage others and get input, less so about having the right questions or rating system.

Catchphrases can create vivid and memorable scenarios that act as heuristics for behavior and decisions. In [The Culture Code][1], Daniel Coyle writes about Danny Meyers as someone who builds a successful culture using a tool I would not have expected, He has the intentional use of catchphrases and quotes to help grow culture and communication. Instead of coming up with long-winded examples for behavior, he comes up with catchy and memorable phrases that can be embedded in communication.

To give a few examples from the book, they all easy to remember, easy to visualize, and guide handling situations:
* Collecting the dots and connecting the dots
* Skunking (spraying negative energy into the workspace)
* Make the charitable assumption
* You can't prevent mistakes, but you can solve problems graciously
* The road to success is paved with mistakes well handled
* Mistakes are like waves, servers are surfers

The value of these is if one person finds them useful, they can be easily picked up and repeated by a 2nd or 3rd degree. As someone who already has a few catchphrases, this stands out to me as an easy way for me (or you!) to intentionally promote a culture. To get started, start writing down the catchphrases or quotes you currently use, put them in one place, start using them more frequently and iterate on the collection.

This is my current collection, you can probably tell where a lot of my focus lives from these alone, but I am excited to see where some increased usage and iteration takes me:
